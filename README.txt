These simulations reproduce the model published in:

Phares, G.A., Antzoulatos, E.G., Baxter, D.A., and Byrne, J.H. (2003)
Burst-induced synaptic depression and its modulation contribute to
information transfer at Aplysia sensorimotor synapses: Empirical and
computational analyses.  J. Neurosci. 23:8392-8401.

The results from one simulation (phares_psp_control.smu) are
illustrated in Phares_control.gif.

To run:

Start SNNAP (double click on the SNNAP.jar file)
click on "Run Simulation"
Then in the new window "File"->"Load Simulation"
browse to and load phares_psp_control.smu
Click "Start"
